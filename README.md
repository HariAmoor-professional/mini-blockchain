# Twitter code submission

This submission is in response to [Elon's recent Tweet](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1879531470886465545) which asks for coding submissions from passionate, i.e., "hardcore", software engineers.

## Personal Background

My name is Hari Amoor; I'm based in northern NJ (Middlesex Township) near NYC.

I'm a first-generation American citizen of Indian origin. My parents, both with backgrounds in IT consulting related to web development and business automation, migrated here (legally!) about 20 years ago; they've gotten through the immigration system and acquired citizenship for themselves, as well as my family, and my father has also sponsored over a thousand people for H1-B visas in the process as a previous small business owner (now a freelancer). For this reason, I'm deeply motivated by the vision shared by Elon and Vivek Ramaswamy, esp. regarding immigration and government efficiency.

I want to help build the "everything app" described by Elon in the given Tweet. I have a libertarian political preference, and I believe in God and capitalism, so free speech is, of course, foundational to my worldview.

I'm passionate about X corporation's mission for the described reasons, so hopefully this code submission is enough to move me forward to the next steps.

## Professional Background

I have 3-4 years' experience in the tech industry, as well as a Bachelor's Degree from Rutgers University as a double major in Computer Science and Math and previous college internships as Facebook (now Meta) and MongoDB (not listed on resume).

Much of my work was as a freelance consultant, so I have a very broad tech stack. I'm a capable full-stack web developer, with knowledge in JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, SQL (and NoSQL, etc.) and also well-practiced in DevOps (platform engineering) work related to containers/Kubernetes and IaC.

Please see my resume attached to the email submission as well as included in this \[./HariAmoorResume.pdf\].

With that said, my real passion is in blockchain and functional programming. I'm very involved in the open-source community of a blockchain called Cardano, which enables smart contract development in the Haskell functional programming language. Haskell is used in many high-assurance settings (i.e., something like firmware for a plane where bugs _have to_ be avoided), and I'm also told that it was once used at Twitter itself!

### Inspiration for this code sample

This code sample was originally prepared as a coding challenge for an interview with [Anastasia Labs](https://anastasialabs.com), a consulting company that works with Cardano. The challenge itself was very technically novel, and I wasn't able to complete every part of it (due to personal difficulties at the time), but I was able to develop some _extremely high-quality code_ (if I do say so myself!) to solve _most_ of the problem.

The code is written in Haskell and built with the [Nix package management system](https://nixos.org). I provide technical details and build instructions in the [README of the subdirectory for docs](docs/README.md). I'd say it's some of my best work, as far as code samples go, but I'm a perfectionist in these matters, so there's always room for improvement!

You don't need particular experience in Haskell to build and run the code; you just need to know how to build/run code using Nix in general. However, it'd be ideal if the engineer reading this has some Haskell knowledge, as the implementation is quite elegant.
